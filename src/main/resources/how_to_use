## Loot Table
Each tier of loot crate/box has its own loot table file. These files are stored in a sub directory of the configuration folder. It is possible to change this directory in the main.cfg.

To add data to the tables all that is required is to add a new JSON entry.


### File format

File: loot_table_tier_#.json
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "loot_min_count": 1,    -- Lower limit of items to drop for the player, this is not item count by loot entries (lowest 1)
    "loot_min_count": 10,   -- Upper limit of items to drop for the player, will be randomly selected (keep value small to reduce lag)
    "loot_entries" :        -- Array of loo entries
    [
      {
        "item": "minecraft:stone",   -- Registry name of the item to drop, prefix with Ore@ to use ore dictionary
        "data": 0,                   -- Metadata value or damage of the item (subtypes, ignored for ore dictionary values)
        "min_count": 1,              -- Lower limit of stack size
        "max_count": 1000,           -- Upper limit of stack size, if over max stack size will drop several items (keep small to reduce lag)
        "chance": 0.5                -- Chance to use this entry (Random Number < chance will result in a drop)
      },
      {
        -- each additional entry will be placed inside {} separated by ,
        -- any missing data will result in a crash, so do not skip entries
      }
    ]
